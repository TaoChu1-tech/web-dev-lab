In this lab, I set up a web development environment by installing VS Code, Git, and Node.js. I then created a simple HTML file and opened it in a browser. Additionally, I set up Git for version control, created a GitHub repository, and pushed my project online. To complete the lab, I also collaborated with a partner on GitHub by contributing to their repository.
